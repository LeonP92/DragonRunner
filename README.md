DragonRunner
============

Independent iOS Application.
Developed in xCode in 2011.
Current Status: Uploaded in the Apple App Store for iOS devices.

Summary: This game was developed as an independent project while I was in high school. It is the second iOS project I undertook in order to get more experience as a developer. DragonRunner is a spinoff of the helicopter game, however instead of non-moving obstacles this game has fireballs flying towards your player.
